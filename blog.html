              <p>Regular maintenance reduces the probability of a car breakdown and,
                   at the same time, extends the vehicle’s life.
                    If there is no proper maintenance of your car parts they can easily get damaged.
                     This why you have to take your vehicle to the proper maintenance </p>

              <h3>car insurance</h3>
              <p>Having car insurance is required by law in most states. 
                  If you are at fault in a car accident, the auto liability coverage required
                   on your car insurance policy helps pay for covered losses, such as the other
                   party's medical bills and damage to their vehicle or other  from the accident

              <h3>battery replacement</h3>
              <p>A weak battery is usually not capable of powering your car. As a result,
                    you need to get your car battery replaced every 3 to 5 years.
                   More often than not, batteries die a premature death owing to external
                    factors and human neglect <br><br></p>

              <p>You should replace your oil filter every time you carry out an oil change.
                   Typically, that means every 10,000km for a petrol car, or every 15,000km for a diesel. However, we recommend that
                   you check your manufacturer's handbook to confirm the specific service interval for your vehicle</p>
